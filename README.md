Repository contains <mark>Rmd</mark> source code with pdf output files.

The folders contain content reviewed in the course and my own addiontal practice.

## Introduction

Work done for "Principles of Data Science" under Dr. Junshu Bao in Fall '19.

The course was divided into the following units:

1. Data Visualization
2. Data Tidying and Wrangling
3. Statistical Models and Bootstrapping
4. Machine Learning

## Section Information

Data Visualization:

Here the focus was on implementing <mark>ggplot</mark> as well as the generic <mark>plot()</mark>
function to explore and present the meaning the data.

Data Tidying and Wrangling:

This section focused on the transformation from messy to clean (tidy) data. Additionally,
time was spent restructuring data to put in the necessary format for analysis. The relevant packages
used were <mark>dplyr</mark> and <mark>tidyr</mark>.

Statistical Models:

Implementation of simple statistical models to explore and predict data from various sources.
Bootstrapping was employed when needed. Along with the aformentioned packages, <mark>broom</mark> and <mark>mosaic</mark> were used.

Machine Learning:

Overview of the implementation of fundamental prediction and classification algorithms in R.
Some packages include <mark>glmnet</mark>, <mark>rpart</mark>, and <mark>Randomforest</mark>.
