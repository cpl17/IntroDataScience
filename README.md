The folders contain content reviewed in the course and my own addiontal practice.

## Introduction

Work done for "Principles of Data Science" under Dr. Junshu Bao in Fall '19.

The course was divided into the following units:

1. Data Visualization
2. Data Tidying and Wrangling
3. Statistical Models and Bootstrapping
4. Machine Learning

## Section Information

_Data Visualization:_

Here the focus was on implementing <code>ggplot</code> as well as the generic <code>plot()</code>
function to explore and present the meaning behind the data.

_Data Tidying and Wrangling:_

This section focused on the transformation from messy to clean (tidy) data. Additionally,
time was spent restructuring data to put in the necessary format for analysis. The relevant packages
used were <code>dplyr</code> and <code>tidyr</code>.

_Statistical Models:_

Explored determining the uncertainty in using various statistics by observing sampling distributions and comparing statistics derived from different methods of sampling. Then, used these statistics to implement simple regression models. Bootstrapping was employed when the distribution of the population was unknown. Along with the aformentioned packages, <code>broom</code> and <code>mosaic</code> were used.

_Machine Learning:_

Contains an overview of the implementation of fundamental prediction and classification algorithms in R with a focus on binary classification. Used popular evaluation methods to observe the accouracy of the final models. Some packages include <code>glmnet</code>, <code>rpart</code>, and <code>Randomforest</code>.
